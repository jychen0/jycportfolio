            <p>Hi! My name is Jason Chen, and I'm a 20-year-old junior at Clark University. I am an aspiring Game Developer majoring in Interactive Media Design and Data Science. I was born in China but have lived in the greater Boston area since I was one year old. I started gaming at a young age with Pokemon Platinum but quickly realized it was much more than a hobby. Playing games and talking to other gamers showed me how games have the power to tell stories, create long-lasting bonds, and build communities. 
            <br /><br />
            I started picking up coding in high school knowing it was one of the most important parts of developing a game. I have since learned multiple coding languages and have hands-on experience with engines like Unity and Unreal Engine for game development. With these skills, I have worked on a few small games and projects to challenge and evolve my skills.
            <br /><br />
            Outside of my education and career goals, I'm a transportation enthusiast from cars to trains to planes. I love watching esports tournaments of my favorite competitive games and even attending the events if I can. I'm always excited to collaborate on new projects, game development related or not, and to chat with new people!
